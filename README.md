## What’s new in v1.2

- **Automatic kernel patch path by iOS major** (A12 / A13)
- On-device **`mount_ich`** — mounts **all** filesystems over SSH (iOS **17 → 27+**)

| iOS | Kernel patches |
|-----|----------------|
| **17 / 18** | Proven finder (`PE_i_can_has_debugger` + `AMFIIsCDHashInTrustCache`) |
| **26** | Fixed byte-offset table (`patch/ios26_kernel_byte_patches.py`) |
| **27+** | Finder + launch constraints (TXM-era) |

iBoot (XR `n841ap` / XS `d321ap` wrappers) is unchanged from the working tree.

## Enter pwned DFU

1. DFU + **RP2350** + [usbliter8](https://github.com/prdgmshift/usbliter8)  
2. Cable to Mac (prefer **USB-A → Lightning**; USB-C adapters are flaky)  
3. Confirm:

```bash
./tools/darwin/irecovery -q
# MODE: DFU   PWND: usbliter8
```

DCSD/serial cables are fine for verbose UART, but **normal USB must reappear as Recovery** after iBoot. `./boot.sh` waits for that USB Recovery mode (and will prompt to unplug/replug if needed).

## Setup

```bash
./setup.sh
# or: brew install python@3 curl blacktop/tap/ipsw && pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick start

```bash
./status.sh
./build.sh         # --kpf-set auto (default): 18→finder, 26→byte table
./boot.sh
```

To make a separately encrypted distribution after a successful build, run:

```bash
./protect_bootchain.sh
```

Enter the password when prompted. This creates one ZIP AES-256 encrypted archive
under `protected/` containing the complete bootchain. Plain originals are
retained because `boot.sh` must send unencrypted IMG4 data to the device.

### Offline/cloud matrix build

No connected device is required when the product, board, and CPID are supplied:

```bash
./build.sh --product iPhone11,8 --model n841ap --cpid 0x8020 --build 22H355
```

The manual GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/build-all-ramdisks.yml`
resolves the newest available iOS/iPadOS 18 and 26 releases for every target in
`ci/targets.tsv`, builds each on an Intel macOS runner, and can upload a separate
AES-256 ZIP artifact. Configure the repository Actions secret
`RAMDISK_ZIP_PASSWORD` before starting it. Artifact upload is disabled by
default and must be explicitly enabled when manually dispatching the workflow.

A12X/A12Z iPad Pro targets are listed separately in
`ci/blocked-a12x-a12z.tsv`: this tree has no `IM4M_0x8027`, and its own build
script marks the required usbliter8 offsets as TBD. They must not be presented
as working outputs until both requirements are supplied and validated.

SSH in, then mount everything:

```bash
iproxy 2222 22
ssh root@localhost -p 2222    # password: alpine
mount_ich                     # mounts all filesystems (System / Preboot / xART / Data / …)
```

`mount_ich` is the only mount command you need. It works on **A12 / A13** for **iOS 17 through 27+**.

If `./boot.sh` stops after “Boot triggered” / iBoot send: unplug and replug once when prompted, use a USB-A cable, and rebuild with `--with-fw`.

### Force a kernel path

```bash
./build.sh --build <BUILD> --with-fw --kpf-set ios18   # finder
./build.sh --build <BUILD> --with-fw --kpf-set ios26   # byte table
./build.sh --build <BUILD> --with-fw --kernel stock    # no kernel patches
```

If iOS 26 byte offsets do not match your exact kernel build, the build fails closed (safe). Update `patch/ios26_kernel_byte_patches.py` for that build, or pass finder fallback only after verifying.

## Layout

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `build.sh` / `boot.sh` | Build → boot; SSH + on-device `mount_ich` |
| `patch/iboot_patchfinder.py` | iBoot IMG4 / CTRR / boot-args |
| `patch/finalize_iboot.py` | `n841ap` / `d321ap` safe wrappers |
| `patch/apply_kernel_patches.py` | Routes 18 vs 26 |
| `patch/ios26_kernel_byte_patches.py` | iOS 26-only offsets |
| `Darwin/` | kairos / cryptic (optional alternate iBoot tools) |
| `tools/darwin/` | img4, irecovery, usbliter8_boot, … |

## Notes

- Proven SSH path: **direct iBEC** (no iBSS required).
- RestoreSEP: `./boot.sh --sep` uses **`rsepfirmware`**.
- After SSH: run **`mount_ich`** once to mount all NAND filesystems.
